   *Yuugen: a profound, mysterious sense of the beauty of the universeâ€¦ and the sad beauty of human suffering.*

What does it mean to atone? How can someone be forgiven and is restitution even possible?

A mistake that changes lives forces Tajima Mika out from her comfortable existence as a senior at Asahikawa Higashi High. The disfavored child of an important father, she has coasted on their family reputation and shallow friendships.

But the new transfer student changes everything. Mika is caught in an unfolding tragedy, all the while a deep and abiding love develops between them.
